        <h1 class="titulo"><strong>TERMS</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>1. I want to make a paid order, what do I do?</strong>
            Welcome to our ‘terms and policy’. We’d like to thank you for your interest in ordering with us!
            Once you dm us, we’ll send you our carrd and you can find all the needed information there. After reading all of it and analyzing our adm’s portfolios, we’ll send you our requests form. In this step, we’ll also answer all your questions.
            It’s important for us that you agree with ALL the information in this document.
            2. What do I do to have my order accepted?
            You don’t need to do anything to be accepted, but it’s important to read our terms and fill the form carefully. We do not require that you follow our account, but by doing so you can get to know our work better. The rules outside of this document don’t apply to paid orders, therefore you’re not required to like our pinned.
            3. The form
            To gather the information about the orders, we use Google’s Forms. You’ll fill it with all the needed information so we can connect your form with your account. In this form, you must write down everything you have in mind for your order. The more information you give us, the closest we’ll get to what you’ve imagined.
            Our form is divided in sections, you only need to fill the sections of your interest. If you can’t find the section you’re looking for, then the type of order you want is made via dm. Orders that require more detailing are usually made through dm since it’s difficult to get specific information in the form.
            In this stage, we’ll talk to you so we can direct you to the right place
            4. Designers
            Blink Design understands that each person has their own taste. So once you're sure you like our work and want to request an order, you can choose the designer you like .
            You need to undertant that our requests are on a first-come, first-served basis, and it may be that the designer of your choice is not available for your deadline. Each designer can have only 5 orders at a time, if already completed, it's not available
            When there is a budget, the designer is free for choosing price, depending on the work that will be done
            In this topic it is important that you understand a little of the creative process:
            1- Listen to the customer, understand all the information. Make sure everything's all right.
            2- Create the idea. This part can take days, creating a different and new idea is difficult. You have to think, draw, look for the sources and more.
            3- After the idea, we need to produce. Development can take a long time, because it may happen that our ideas do not match the end result. In addition we want to deliver to our client the best work and so it is reviewed several times.
            4- Send to the customer and if necessary make changes or return to the part of the idea.
            5. Order quantity
            As explained in the previous topic, each designer can take up 5 orders at a time. It’s very important for us to take care of their mental and physical health. If you really want to order more than 5 things or if the designer you chose is already full of orders, you’ll have to wait. After they finish everything they have in line, you can make your request with them.
            We want you to be able to make you order with us but we hope you understand that many orders will overload our designers, that’s why we follow this rule very strictly.
            We can talk and agree with the quantity of your order together, but nothing too big.
            6. Deadline
            Our deadlines aren’t fixed. We make orders by arrival, so if the designer you chose have other orders in front of yours, you’ll have to wait in line.
            You can check your order in our schedule (it’s in our pinned and in our carrd)
            If you have a deadline, let us know and we’ll check if we can make it in time. Don’t put your deadline in the form.
            The quantity of orders and what you ask for affect the time we take to finish everything. The bigger and the more complicated your order is, the more time it’ll take for us to deliver it to you. The designer that’ll be working with you will explain more about this and about their deadline.
            Do not rush us. It may not look like it but our work can take a lot of time. You can send us a message asking about how the order is going but don’t exaggerate. We’ll try to keep you updated, so don’t worry.
            You can check our Instagram and Twitter (we post all of our deliveries there). If there’s any problem, we’ll let you know via dm.
            7. Payment
            It’s very important for us that you pay for something you like, that’s why the payment if made after the preview of the order. In the preview you’ll check if you like it and, if needed you’ll ask for modifications.
            Since we work like this, if you decide to cancel after we finished the work, we will loose our work.
            In orders equal or exceeding $10,00, we’ll ask for half of it before we start and the rest after we finish. If this order is cancelled before we start it, the down payment we’ll be returned. If we had already started it, we’ll keep the money.
            Our payment deadline is 7 days, but in case of different situations we can extend this deadline.If we go without an answer for a long time, we’ll cancel your order and sell it to another person.
            Our payment method for people outside Brazil is Paypal (contains tax). Each designer receives the payment in their own account. Payment is only done by US currency, Dollar.
            8. Modifications
            You can ask for modifications after seeing the preview, they can cost between $1,00 to $3,00 (depending on their size). The price will be decided by the designer.
            9. Cancellations
            If you need to cancel your order, it has to be cancelled before we start to make it. If you decide to cancel after we started it, you will have to pay a tax of $2,00 and we’ll block you. Our designers spend a lot of time in your order, making something special for you, something that’s already ready and then you cancel it. That’s why we ask you to only order if you’re going to finish it.
            We’ll also cancel your order if you’re rude to our adm’s or if there are several problems during the process of making the order. We usually do this in extreme cases but if needed, we’ll do it. Depending on what happened we might block you.
            10. Commitment
            After reading everything, you can send us a dm. We’re committed to your order, we’ll make it as requested, we expect you to trust our work.
            Every problem will be talked to you. We’re compromised to your deadline. The trust is mutual, we’ll trust you in this process and we hope you trust us too.
            11. Credits
            You don’t have to credit us but if you want, we would be very grateful! The credits are our feedback, so they’re very important for us.
            12. Thank you!
            Thanks for your interest! We’re looking forward to working with you and we hope you understood everything. Our dms is open in case of doubts </p>
