        <h1 class="titulo"><strong>TERMS</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>1. I WANT TO PLACE AN ORDER, WHAT’S THE PROCESS?</strong><br><br><br>
            Welcome to our terms and policies. First of all, we’d like to thank you for your interest in ordering from us!<br><br>
            The process starts when you contact us via DM/Direct to let us know you want to place an order. After that, we’ll send you a link to our website, where you’ll find all the information you need, such as our price list and terms of service/purchase.<br><br>
            After reading the terms and choosing the designer of your preference, we’ll send you a form to fill out with the necessary information for the design production. At this stage, we also answer any questions our clients may have.<br><br>
            It’s important that you agree with all the information in this document.<br><br><br>

            <strong>2. WHAT SHOULD I DO FOR MY ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED?</strong><br><br><br>

            During the order process, you don’t need to do anything special to be accepted. The key is to read the terms carefully and fill out the form attentively. Following our account is not mandatory, but through our social media you’ll get a better sense of our work.<br><br>
            Rules outside of this document do not apply to paid orders, so liking our pinned post is not required.<br><br><br>
            
            <strong>3. HOW DOES THE FORM WORK?</strong><br><br><br>
            We use Google Forms to collect order information. Once we send the link, you’ll fill out basic info so we can link your form to your account.<br><br>
            In this form, we ask you to write all the ideas and information you have in mind about your request. The more detailed you are, the better the final result.<br><br>
            The form is divided into sections. You’ll only fill out the parts relevant to the type of order you’re placing.<br><br>
            If you don’t find the type of order you want in the form, that order should be made via DM/Direct since it likely has specific requirements (like creating a visual identity), and the form doesn’t apply. <br><br>
            In that case, the chosen designer will talk to you directly and gather the necessary details.<br><br><br>

            <strong>4. ABOUT THE DESIGNERS</strong><br><br><br>

            Blink Design understands that everyone has their own unique taste. So once you’re sure you like our work and want to place an order, you can choose a designer to work with.<br><br>
            Keep in mind that we process orders in the order they’re received, so your chosen designer may not be available within your desired timeframe. Availability depends on each designer, as they manage their own schedules.<br><br>
            When your order does not have a fixed price and needs a quote, the designer has full freedom to set the price. It’s important to understand our creative process:<br><br><br>
             <strong>Step 1:</strong> Listen to the client and gather all information, ensuring it’s complete and clear.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Develop the concept. This step may take a few days because creating something unique and original takes patience and care. It involves brainstorming, sketching, choosing appropriate typography, and more.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Produce the design. This part can take some time, as the initial concept might not match the final outcome. We want to deliver the best possible result, so multiple revisions may be needed.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Send the preview to the client and, if necessary, make adjustments until reaching the final version.<br><br><br>
            
            <strong>5. CLARIFICATION ABOUT ORDERS</strong><br><br><br>

            It’s important to know what you’re ordering because each item has its own price and must be charged accordingly.<br><br>
            A PNG image is not a logo, just like a banner is not the same as a social media post. They are different services, each with its own value and purpose.<br><br>
            While we don’t refuse to deliver any orders, if we find that someone tried to get a specific design (like a logo) through an alternative request at a lower price (below what’s listed in our price table), they may be blocked, and we will no longer accept their orders.<br><br><br>

            <strong>6. ORDER QUANTITY</strong><br><br><br>

            There is no maximum order quantity, but as explained earlier, each designer manages their own workload and accepts the number of orders they can handle. This is crucial for maintaining our team’s physical and mental well-being.<br><br>
            If you want to request a quote but the designer already has pending work, you can either wait or choose another available designer. We want you to be able to place all your orders with us, so we’ll do our best to find the best solution for your case.<br><br><br>            
            
            <strong>7. DELIVERY TIME</strong><br><br><br>

            Our delivery time is not fixed.<br><br>
            As explained earlier, we complete orders in the order they’re received. If your designer has other orders before yours, yours will enter the queue.<br><br>
            If you have a specific deadline, let the designer know via DM/Direct. Please note that for orders with deadlines of 7 days or less, we charge an urgency fee:<br><br><br>

            <strong>For orders from $50.00, a 40% fee is added.</strong> For example, if the order is $100.00, the urgency fee is $40.00, totaling $140.00.<br><br>

            <strong>For orders under $50.00, a flat fee of $10.00 is added. </strong>For example, an order of $20.00 would total $30.00.<br><br>

            This is because your request would need to skip ahead of others, requiring us to rearrange our schedule.<br><br>
            We’ll check designer availability and find one who can meet your deadline. Please don’t write the deadline in the form—inform us via DM/Direct.<br><br>
            Another factor that affects delivery time is the number and type of requests. Larger or more complex orders take longer to develop. Your designer will explain what they need and how much time they’ll require.<br><br>
            Don’t rush us. It may not seem like it, but our work takes time. You can message us about your order, but please don’t overdo it. We’ll always try to keep you updated.<br><br>
            You can also check our Instagram and Twitter to see our work. If any issue arises, we’ll inform you via DM/Direct.<br><br><br>

            <strong>8. PAYMENT METHODS</strong><br><br><br>

            It’s important to us that you pay for something you’re happy with, so we have a few policies here.<br><br><br>

            <strong>For orders from R$ 50.00, you must pay half upfront (before the preview) and the rest after preview approval.<br><br>
            If the order is canceled before production, the upfront payment will be refunded. If it’s canceled after the preview, the initial payment is non-refundable.</strong><br><br>
            For orders under R$ 50.00, payment is made only after preview approval.<br><br>
            If you cancel the order during production, both client and designer may face a loss. Please be mindful when placing your order.<br><br>
            For orders above R$ 50.00, payment of the first half must be made within 7 days of confirming the order. Work starts only after payment. For orders under R$ 50.00, payment must be made within 7 days after the preview.<br><br>
            In both cases, payment dates can be discussed with the designer if needed.<br><br>
            If we don’t hear from you for over 30 days, the order will be canceled, and the design may be resold to another client.<br><br>
            <strong>Our payment method is: </strong> PayPal (which includes a fee).<br><br><br>

            <strong>9. REVISIONS</strong><br><br><br>

            After receiving the preview, you may request any changes you find necessary.<br><br>
            If the changes are significant and alter the work considerably, the designer may charge for them, and you’ll be informed. Revision costs start at $ 2.00.<br><br><br>

            <strong>10. CANCELED ORDERS</strong><br><br><br>

            If you need to cancel, let us know before production starts. Otherwise, as mentioned, the upfront payment is non-refundable, and the work may be sold to someone else. If the same client repeatedly cancels, they may be blocked.<br><br>
            We ask you to understand how serious this is. The designer may have spent hours or days working on your project, and canceling at the last minute is unfair. Only begin the process if you plan to finish it.<br><br>
            In extreme cases, if the client is disrespectful, we may cancel the order. If needed, your account may also be blocked.<br><br><br>

            <strong>11. COMMITMENT</strong><br><br><br>

            After reading all this, contact us via DM/Direct if you agree with everything. Once we start, we are fully committed to your order. We will meet the deadlines and complete the project as agreed. We hope you trust our work.<br><br>
            We will discuss any issues with you. We won’t miss deadlines or deliver unfinished work. Trust is mutual—we trust you, so we ask you to trust us.<br><br><br>

            <strong>12. CREDITS</strong><br><br><br>
            You don’t have to credit us for paid orders. However, if you like our work and want to help us grow, we’d love for you to share it!<br><br>
            Credits are a form of feedback and are very valuable to us. If possible, tag us when sharing!<br><br><br>
            
            <strong>13. THANK YOU!</strong><br><br><br>
            Thanks for your interest! We look forward to working with you and hope everything is clear. Our DM/Direct is open for any questions.</p>
